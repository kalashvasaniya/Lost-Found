Hi!, this **readme** file familiarizes us with the idea behind our website 'Lost & Found'.   


# Purpose
The main idea was to create a platform where the students can easily locate the lost items with the help of other students who found these misplaced items anywhere in the campus. It supports two features Lost and Found.

# Features
1) LOST- Lost tab allows the user to search for an item he/she has lost anywhere in the campus. User only has to search for the missing product and if the item is present in our database it will be shown to the user.

2) FOUND- Found tab presents user with the opportunity to list different items that any student has found in the campus that is not theirs. The person who found the item has to enter the basic details in the form given on the found tab.
